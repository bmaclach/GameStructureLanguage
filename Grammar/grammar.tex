\noindent \textbf{Pretty-printed EBNF grammar:}
\begin{grammar}
<game> ::= <roundList> `played by' <teamList>

<teamList> ::= <team> \{`,' <team>\} | <playerList> | `randomly divide' 
<playerList> `into' <nameList>

<team> ::= `team' <name> <playerList>

<playerList> ::= <player> \{`;' <player>\}

<player> ::= <name> <attributeList> 

<attributeList> ::= <attribute> \{`,' <attribute>\}

<attribute> ::= <affiliation> | <score> | <resource>

<affiliation> ::= 'affiliated with' <name> 

<score> ::= `score' <name> <number> 

<resource> ::= `resource' <name> <number>

<roundList> ::= <round> \{`;' <round>\} [<modifierList>]

<round> ::= <phase> \{`,' <phase>\} [`repeated' <number> `times']

<phase> ::= <action> | <progression>

<action> ::= <competition> | <decision>

<competition> ::= [`scored' | `placed'] `competition between' <idList>

<decision> ::= `vote by' <idList> `between' <idList> | 'nomination of' <number> 
`of' <idList> `by' <identifier> | `allocate' | `binary' %allocate resources, 
%binary is for yes/no, up/down type decisions.

<progression> ::= `update' <identifier> <attribute> `to' <value>

<idList> ::= <identifier> \{`,' <identifier>\} [`except' <idList>]

<identifier> ::= `everyone' | <name> | <name> | <reference> | `chance' %name | 
%affiliation

<reference> ::= `winner' | `loser' | `voted'

<value> ::= <name> | <number>

<name> ::= [a-zA-Z] {[a-zA-Z0-9 ]}

<value> ::= [0-9]+

\end{grammar}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow for random decisions
	\item Vote tiebreakers?
	\item Players - mandatory attributes? just affiliation? affiliation, score, 
	resources, only included if used?
	\item Win condition or update affiliation to winner for someone in last 
	round? Have a progression shortcut for win?
	\item index challenge/votes/phases or name them with identifiers?
	\item shortcuts for repeating a round, inserting a modifier into a complete 
	set of rounds
	\item make grammar unambiguous
	\item multiple votes? 
	\item I've restricted player attributes into 3 categories, with no 
	opportunity for customization outside those three. Am I okay with this?
	\item modifiers for player lists? i.e. every player starts out with a vote 
	resource of 20
