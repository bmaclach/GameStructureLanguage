\noindent \textbf{Pretty-printed EBNF grammar:}
\begin{grammar}
<game> ::= <roundList> `played by' <teamList> `wonBy' <winConditionList>

<teamList> ::= (<team> \{`,' <team>\} | <playerList> | `randomly divide' 
<playerList> `into' <nameList>) [`all' <attributeList>]

<team> ::= `team' <name> <playerList>

<playerList> ::= <player> \{`;' <player>\}

<player> ::= <name> <attributeList>

<attributeList> ::= <attribute> \{`,' <attribute>\}

<attribute> ::= <affiliation> | <score> [<number>] | <resource> [<number>]

<affiliation> ::= 'affiliated with' <name>

<score> ::= `score' <name>

<resource> ::= `resource' <name>

<roundList> ::= <round> \{`;' <round>\} [<modifierList>]

<modifierList> ::= <modifier> \{`,' <modifier>\}

<modifier> ::= <roundReference> (`before' | `after') <phaseReference> `insert' 
<phase>

<roundReference> ::= `round' <number>

<phaseReference> ::= `phase' <number>

<round> ::= <phase> \{`,' <phase>\} [`repeated' <number> `times']

<phase> ::= <action> | <progression>

<action> ::= <competition> | <decision>

<competition> ::= [`scored' | `placed'] [`team'] `competition between' <idList> 
%optional scored placed because will default to placed?

<decision> ::= [`self-included'] `vote by' <idList> `between' <idList> 
[`tiebroken by' 
(<decision> | <competition>)] | [`self-included'] `nomination of' <number> 
`of' <idList> `by' <identifier> | `allocate' <resource> | `binary' %for yes/no, 
%up/down type decisions.

<progression> ::= (<affiliationUpdate> | <scoreUpdate>  | <resourceUpdate>) 
`for' <idList>

<affiliationUpdate> ::= `elimination' | (`add' | `remove') <affiliation> | 
[`evenly' | `number preserving'] `swap' <affiliationList> [`adding' 
<affiliationList>] | `change' <affiliation> `to' <affiliation>

<scoreUpdate> ::= (`increase' | `decrease') <score> `by' <earning> | `set' 
<score> `to' <earning> 

<resourceUpdate> ::= (`gain' | `expend') <earning> <resource> | `set' 
<resource> `to' <earning> 

<earning> ::= <number> | <resultReference> | <allocateReference>

<resultReference> ::= `scored competition' <number> 

<allocateReference> ::= `allocation' <number> `amount'

<idList> ::= <identifier> \{`,' <identifier>\} [`except' <idList>]

<identifier> ::= (`everyone' | <name> | <affiliation> | <idReference> | 
`chance') [`*' <earning>]

<idReference> ::= <compReference> (`winner' | `loser') | <voteReference> 
(`majority' | `minority') `voted' 

<compReference> ::= `placed competition' <number>

<voteReference> ::= `vote' <number>

<allocationReference> ::= `allocation' <number>

<name> ::= (`a' | ... | `z' | `A' | ... | `Z') \{`a' | ... | `z' | `A' | ... | 
`Z' | `0' | ... | `9'\}

<number> ::= (`0' | ... | `9')+

<winCondition> ::= (<score> | <resource>) `hits' <number> | `final competition' 
| (`highest' | `lowest') (<score> | <resource>) | <number> `member jury vote'

<winConditionList> ::= <winCondition> \{`,' <winCondition>\}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item make grammar unambiguous
	\item Potentially include "directed vote" type of decision where a player 
	chooses another player as well as a direction (i.e. move that player ahead 
	or backwards)
	\item I've restricted player attributes into 3 categories, with no 
	opportunity for customization outside those three. Am I okay with this?
	\item affiliation used everywhere, get syntax right
	\item should allocate be a decision and progression or just progression? 
	Both, but decision will automatically also do the progression. The 
	progression exists for non-decision related resource updates, such as 
	awarding a player more of a resource for winning a competition.
	\item combine score and resource?
\end{itemize}
