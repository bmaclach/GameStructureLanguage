This Game Structure Language allows you to define a game structure using natural language, then generate a program that manages the progression of the game for you! Notably, this is not a tool for generating games that can be played in isolation. Rather, it generates a "game runner" that will manage the game state and progression, but must be fed the results of external actions, such as decisions made by the players.

Currently, the Game Structure Language is too simplistic to have much practical use. However, it may one day evolve to be practically useful for the purpose for which it is being designed: as a game runner for Online Reality Games (ORGs). In the context of an ORG, this tool could eliminate any potential for human error and decrease the effects of bias from a human host on the results of a game.
