Project Plan, 3/3:
Good topic; include a discussion of related languages or approaches;
not clear what the generated code would do and how that would be used to
develop a whole game.

Poster Presentation 7/7:
Good selection of material for the poster, in particular background research, good outlook; fun demo!

Implementation 20/20:
Interesting, ambitious topic, good choice of implementation techniques, thoroughly testing, good documentation throughout
Well done!
